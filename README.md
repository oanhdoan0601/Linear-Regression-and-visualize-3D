# Linear-Regression-and-visualize-3D (Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib,mpl_toolkit.mplot3D)
this project demonstrates to predict the house price by using linear regression and try to understand how the dependent and independent variables relate to variable (‘askprice’) - the house sale price.
and visualize  the results on 3D
Dataset: home.csv can download from https://github.com/softporcupine/pandas-matplotlib-example/blob/master/home_data.csv
In order to minimize the cost function of Multivariate Linear Regression, the project implemented 3 variants of Gradient Descent algorithm
Batch Gradient Descent
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

plot the results on 3D
